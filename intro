What is a Sorting Algorithm?
      Sorting algorithms are a set of instructions that take an array or list as an input and arrange the items into a particular order (sorting particular ordder)
      
why we use Sorting
      reduce the complexity of a problem
      These algorithms have direct applications in searching algorithms database algorithms, divide and conquer methods, data structure algorithms, and many more.

TYPES:
     Selection sort
     Bubble sort
     Insertion sort
     Merge sort
     Quick sort
     Heap sort
    Counting sort
    Radix sort
    Bucket sort
